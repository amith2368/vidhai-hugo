                <h3 class="text-black text-uppercase">Vidhai(2014-2016)</h3>
                <p class="text-black" style="font-size: 20px;">Vidhai was initiated in 2014 by a bunch of students who wanted to help for the education of the underprivileged children. They visited government schools in villages  surrounding our campus such as kandigai, keerapakkam, kumizhi and melakottaiyur. They conducted both teaching and non-teaching activities in the schools. They conducted 27 hours of session during that period.</p>
                <h3 class="text-black text-uppercase">Vidhai(2019-2020)</h3>
                <p class="text-black" style="font-size: 20px">Vidhai was re-initiated in October 2019 with more active volunteers and an organized structure of work. We split ourselves into teams and each were alloted with their own responsibilities. We started teaching the 6th to 8th std students of the Kumizhi Government School. We conducted 6 teaching sessions (each 3 hours) on Saturdays (Jan to Feb, 2020) and 1 visit of the 9th class students to the TLC (Teaching and Learning Centre) in our campus.</p>
                <p class="text-black" style="font-size: 20px">
                    We taught Maths, Science and English through activity based and interactive teaching/learning methods which created enthusiasm in the students. During our feedback sessions, we identified some problems which lead us to the idea of development of a unique and versatile curriculum called EQUIPPED which we are going to follow in the academic year 2020-2021.

The idea behind this curriculum was to ‘equip’ children with specific knowledge about certain topics that will be very much useful for them when they become adults. The objective of this curriculum is to produce well informed and responsible citizens for our country. There are 15 programs (topics) that we will be teaching the students.

            <p class="mb-5 text-black" style="font-size: 18px">For classes 7th and 9th, we teach them from basics. For 8th and 10th class we teach them tricks/shortcuts and give a lot of mock exams We also offer a set of videos and online tests for these students so that they get a better understanding of the subject and learn however many times they want to.</p>
